<!---Survey conducted in “Introduction to Data Science” at Columbia, taught by Rachel Schutt-->

## Lectures

Mondays. 6.10 - 8pm

Don’t be late (it disrupts class and concentration). 

Bring a laptop if available. 
(*but check your facebook at home).

![ ](images/desktop_computer_at_starbucks.jpg){ width=60% }

## Books & Readings

- No required text book. Yay!
- Several recommended books (available in the bookstore this week). All of the books are also on [reserve](https://www1.columbia.edu/sec-cgi-bin/cul/respac/respac?CRSE=20181qmss5063g001) in the library.

## <span style="color:white;">Taking Notes</span> { data-background-color="black"}

![](images/rmarkdown_logo.png){width=50%}

## Taking Notes

- In class there will be a lot of back and forth between general explanatory material, bits of code, comments to ourselves, and other stuff

- My suggestion: take notes in [RStudio](www.rstudio.com) using R Markdown notebooks or a simple R Markdown file

- I suggest the same for assignments (more on that later).

- More info here: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/


## Why R Markdown?

PRO:

- Reproducible. For others and your later (forgetful) self.

- Live document. Combining code and output. Changes to your data or code will immediately update.

- supports numerous static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, slides, shiny applications

- able to run different languages in one document

CON: 

- Typesetting not as detailed as Latex [R Markdown is designed for HTML, Latex for PDFs]

## {data-background-iframe="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html"} 

## R Studio - Let’s do a quick intro

- Create a new project. 
- Create a new notebook file.

<br><br>

- For later: make some folders (Lectures / Exercises / Final Project etc.) to keep order.  
- If unfamiliar with R Markdown, work through http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ or similar tutorials to get going. 

## Course Website

- Piazza for discussion forum, announcements. Make sure to set your notification settings right.

- All lectures slides, in-class exercises, homework, code etc. will be made available here: https://github.com/QMSS-G5063-2020/course_materials

- Brief introduction to GitHub next week.

## Assignments 

- Final report (30%): A final group project in the form of a website and (if time allows) an in-class presentation.

- Assignments (60%): 4 individual assignments.

- Class participation (off line and online) & commentary on other student project (10%)

## Student Groups

- Final report is a group project with 3-4 students in each group.
- Try to find a group as soon as you can. Join groups set up on campuswire site.
- Will need to agree on a dataset to analyze (eiter choose from my suggestions or one of your own).
- These groups will also be one of your resources to master the course material.

## To Do for you

- Get R. Get R Studio. Bring laptop to class if you can.

- Install packages: 
ggplot2 / data.table / tidyverse  \& any others that are used in exercises

- Get to know your fellow students to form a group.

# What makes for good data visualization?
## Types of Visualizations

![ ](images/exploratory_explanatory.png){ width=100% }

## Let's look at some graphs to warm up...

Which values are presented here?

![ ](images/3D_chart.png){ width=70% }

## Did you guess right?

![ ](images/3D_chart_values.png){ width=100% }

## Mmhh! Pie

![ ](images/pie_chart.png){ width=50% }

## Got it right this time?

![ ](images/pie_chart_values.png){ width=80% }

## What makes these graphs (or other figures) not work very well?

- **Misleading** -- The information provided is difficult to obtain or even misleading. Why?
- **Wrong form** -- To allow comparison, the viewer needs to be able to make comparison quickly and accurately.
- **Too much, or too little** Not all information is provided to make an assessment, or too much information that clouds the important stuff.
- **Poor design** -- Information may be provided, but the figure is ugly.

## Circles are rarely good choices for comparison

## Same information -- much more readable

## A good visualization 

1. It is **truthful**: reliable information from honest research
2. It is **functional**: organized in a way that enables at least some exploration, when it’s appropriate
3. It is **beautiful**: attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing
4. It is **insightful**:  reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise

## Other principles of data visualization
- each week, we will add a few guidelines or principles of data visualization 
- with examples from others or our own, we will learn what works and what does not
- **Lessons from today**: 3D and circular displays of information are rarely good ideas (and we will learn exactly why in the next data viz principles section)
- for now, let's get to practice actually making graphs a bit

# Let's get started with ggplot2
## An example: GDP and Life Expectancy

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)  # 'gapminder' package contains the data
gapminder           # Let's take a look at the data
```

## Another look at the data frame

```{r}
str(gapminder)      # str() is a good way to look at the data frame
```

## Simple Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) # nothing to plot yet!
```

## Simple Scatterplot

We can make the graph into an object to alter and add stuff later:
```{r, }
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) 
```

* we create an object p, containing the pieces of information that we are interested in plotting with ggplot
* x = gdpPercap and y = lifeExp define what will go in the x and y axes
* they are "aesthetic mappings" connecting pieces of data with the visibles in the plot

## Simple Scatterplot

```{r, }
p + geom_point()   # Now we tell ggplot that we want a satter plot
```

## Simple Scatterplot

```{r, }
ggplot( data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
        geom_point()   
  # Of course, we can write that in one swoop
```

## Log Transformation

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

## Let's keep that scale setting

```{r}
p <- p + scale_x_log10()
```

## **Map** continent variable to aesthetic color
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent))
```

## To recap: full plot command thus far

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + scale_x_log10() 
```
<small> Note, we put the aes() in the geom_point() element. We will see in a bit why. </small>

## Reduce overplotting 
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent), alpha = 0.3, size=3)  
  # Setting transparency of points
```

## Adding fitted curve
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + geom_smooth()  
  # by default, adds a loess fit
```

## Adding fitted curve
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + 
  geom_smooth(color="black", lwd=2, se=FALSE)  
   # removing the confidence intervals
```

## We could exchange the order of the layers

```{r}
p + geom_smooth(color="black", lwd=2, se=FALSE) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) 
```

## Use a linear fit instead
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + geom_smooth(method="lm")  
```

## Smooth fit by continent

```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE, aes(color = continent))
```

## Now all layers use the continent grouping

```{r}
# We could add the aes() grouping to the overall graph p
p <- p + aes(color = continent)
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE)
```


## Why another color=continent?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Our original plot command:
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() 

# A single smoothed line through all points:
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth()

# Using the color aesthetic for the smoothing as well as the scatter points
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(lwd=2, se=FALSE)

# Still single smoothed line but now points are colored by continent:
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(color="black")
```

# Grammar of Graphics
## The Grammar of Graphics

- ggplot is based on a "grammar" of graphics, an idea originated with Wilkinson (2005)

![ ](images/grammar_of_graphics.jpeg){width=30%}

## Main principles

* there are few main principles:
    + Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements (or grammar rules) that map pieces of data to geometric objects (like lines and points) and attributes (like color and size)
    + if necessary some additional rules about scales, projections in a coordinate system, and data transformations are possible
    + Plots arise through aesthetic mapping
* The grammar produces “sentences” (mappings of data to objects) but they can easily be garbled if you define poor mappings.

## Three key grammatical elements

| Element | Description | 
|------:|:-----:|
| **Data** | The dataset being plotted. |
| **Aes**thetics | The scales onto which we map our data. |
| **Geom**etries | The visual elements used for our data. | 

- every ggplot2 plot has these three key components

## All seven grammatical elements

| Element | Description | 
|------:|:-----:|
| **Data** | The dataset being plotted. |
| **Aes**thetics | The scales onto which we map our data. |
| **Geom**etries | The visual elements used for our data. | 
| **Facet**s | Plotting subsets of the data. | 
| **Stat**istics | Statistical representations of our data to aid understanding. | 
| **Coord**inates | The space on which the data will be plotted. | 
| **Theme**s | All non-data ink. |
